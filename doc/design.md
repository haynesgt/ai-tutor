# Language Learning

As a student, every day, I want to be able to go to the app and make progress in learning a language.

I want an easy process for determining language level. I want to do short lessons based on what I have been learning already, and based on my interests.

## Design iteration 1

The user goes to the homepage.

In a couple of clicks they can indicate that they want to learn a language, or continue where they left off.

They are then presented with a bunch of simple questions about what they have learned already and what sorts of things they are interested in.

### Sample Questions

- What language would you like to learn?
- Have you studied this language before? If yes, for how long?
- What is your current proficiency level? (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- What topics are you most interested in? (e.g., travel, business, culture, daily conversations)
- How much time can you dedicate to learning each day?
- Do you prefer visual, auditory, or interactive learning methods?
- Are you preparing for a specific goal? (e.g., exam, travel, work)
- Would you like to focus on speaking, listening, reading, or writing skills?
- Do you have any favorite topics or hobbies you'd like to incorporate into your lessons?
- What motivates you to learn this language?

These questions should be adaptive based on the language they chose and things people learning that language usually want.

Based on the questions they have answered, they are given some options for a long term plan (or just try things out) for what they will be learning.

### Sample Language Learning Plans

    - Practicing real-life scenarios relevant to the user
    - Tracking progress with regular assessments

They can then start a lesson. They will be presented with some options for what sort of lesson to do and then begin.


## Design Iteration 2

The user is prompted with a friendly message, greeting them and inviting them to start studying. If they have been there before, it should continue where they left off.

They are given some buttons to click to continue, or they can talk to the ai tutor directly.

The AI will generate interactive lessons as needed. It can save data, load data, query data via SQL to assist with adapting the lessons to the user and tracking thair progress. It can present various sorts of forms like flashcards or multiple choice.

The learning process should be fun stuff.

Here are some sorts of interactive lessons the AI might want to generate:

- **Flashcard Challenges**: The AI presents vocabulary or phrases on flashcards, and the user guesses the meaning or pronunciation. Add a timer for extra excitement.
- **Interactive Dialogues**: Simulated conversations where the user selects or types responses to practice real-life scenarios (e.g., ordering food, booking a hotel).
- **Listening Quizzes**: Play short audio clips, and the user answers questions about what they heard (e.g., identifying key words or summarizing the content).
- **Word Matching Games**: Match words with their meanings, synonyms, or images to reinforce vocabulary.
- **Grammar Puzzles**: Fill-in-the-blank exercises or sentence rearrangement games to practice grammar rules.
- **Pronunciation Practice**: The AI listens to the userâ€™s pronunciation and provides feedback or scores.
- **Cultural Trivia**: Fun quizzes about the culture, history, or traditions of the language being learned.
- **Story Building**: The user selects words or phrases to complete a story, practicing vocabulary and sentence structure.
- **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Simulate real-life situations where the user practices speaking or writing (e.g., introducing themselves, asking for directions).
- **Memory Games**: Show a list of words or phrases briefly, then ask the user to recall as many as possible.
- **Interactive Videos**: Watch a short video and answer questions or fill in missing dialogue.
- **Daily Challenges**: A surprise task each day, such as describing an image, translating a sentence, or writing about a topic.
- **Language Bingo**: Create a bingo card with vocabulary or grammar points, and the user marks off items as they practice.
- **Speed Rounds**: Quick-fire questions on vocabulary, grammar, or listening comprehension with a countdown timer.
- **Creative Writing Prompts**: The AI provides a topic or scenario, and the user writes a short paragraph or dialogue.
- **Song Lyrics Practice**: Listen to a song in the target language and fill in missing lyrics or answer questions about the song.
- **Interactive Maps**: Explore a map in the target language, learning place names, directions, and cultural landmarks.
